#This app was built to showcase our work on the Cyber-Physical Risks of Hacked Internet-Connected Vehicles. The original code for the work is at: https://github.com/dyanni3/Traffic-Simulations

In 2015, a group of white-hat hackers showed that a single Jeep Grand Cherokee can be hacked remotely. Imagine a scenario where hackers breach multiple vehicles on the road, leading to multiple roads being blocked. White segments are those accessible. As more and more roads get blocked, more and more of the city fades away (roads are inaccessible). We find that it just takes 10-20% of vehicles on the road to cause half the city to be disrupted from the rest. Form more, see the app below:
